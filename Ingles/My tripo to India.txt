I went to the India 6 months ago, before to go I was watching videos about the daily life, the food has been one of the most strangest
experiences I have had, I'm stil having some stomache problems. I've vesited several doctors, they told me I developed a strange
bacteria and it's killing me. I visited the Ganges river, it was the weirdest experience I've had, while I was recording, The people
were taking a shower, other drinking water, other fishing and burning dead bodies. Let me tell you I'm not thinking about go back
there, I've decided to forget everything I lived in that place.
