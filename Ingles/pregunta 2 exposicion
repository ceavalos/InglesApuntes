whats your opinion about children who are sufering. Who's fault?

When it comes to children who are suffering, it is important to approach the issue with empathy and compassion. Children can suffer due to a variety of factors, including poverty, conflict, violence, abuse, neglect, lack of access to education or healthcare, and other systemic issues.

Assigning blame for the suffering of children is a complex matter, and it is often the result of a combination of factors and circumstances. Responsibility can be attributed to individuals, families, communities, governments, and even broader societal structures.


Individuals: In some cases, the suffering of children can be attributed to the actions or choices of individuals, such as parents or caregivers who neglect or abuse them. However, it is important to remember that individual actions are often influenced by broader social, economic, and cultural factors.
