in my oponion the correct order to be success in a carreer are

2) skills --> the ability to do something well, Take training courses, Practice, Learn from others
              Take on a new challenge
3) work habits --> They're repetitive activities that develop into specific patterns in time at work
                   or at your home office Like checking off emails first thing in the morning, sending
                   your work for review before you finish a task, or even placing your bag in the same
                   spot every day
4)job knowledge --> Measures employee's demonstrated job relevant knowledge and essential skills, such
                    as work practices, policies               
5) physical appereance, dress, --> i consider that the factor could do a difference are essential and simple things such as how you speak, how you dress and your interaction with others.. 
6) prior experience --> this is a factor that you will adquire with the time, but when you are new you
                         need put attencion to the factors i told before.
